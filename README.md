# Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection

In this Kaggle competition, [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview), my goal is to build a Convolutional Neuro Network (CNN) model to identify metastatic cancer in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections.

The 'train' folder contains over 220,000 small pathology images, each named with a unique image ID. The 'train_label.csv' file provides the corresponding id and label for each image. A positive label indicates that the central 32Ã—32 px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.
